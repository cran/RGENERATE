Description: A method 'generate()' is implemented in this package for the random
    generation of vector time series according to models obtained by 'RMAWGEN',
    'vars' or other packages.  This package was created to generalize the
    algorithms of the 'RMAWGEN' package for the analysis and generation of any
    environmental vector time series.
